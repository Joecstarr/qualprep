Professors Ionut Chifan and Paul Muhly

August 15, 2018

Instructions. Be sure to put your name on each booklet you use.

This examination has a number of "true-false" questions in it. When a problem is a true-false problem, the operative statement will be preceded by True-False?. You are to decide whether it is true or false. If you think it is true, you must provide a proof. If you think it is false, you must provide a counter example or a proof of why it is false. No points will be given for a correct guess that the problem is true or false without any justification. Also, there will be no "Bankruptcy" points given.

The exam is divided into two parts. The first covers real analysis and the second covers complex analysis. Each part has 5 problems. You need only work 4 problems in each part. You must indicate which 4 you are submitting for evaluation. If you want to do five in a part, that is OK. We will treat the extra problem as a bonus, but still mark the four problems (in each part) that you think are your best work.

\section{Part I}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $f$ be a real-valued function defined on the interval $[0,1]$. True-False? If $f$ is not of bounded variation on $[0,1]$, then there is a point $x_{0}$ in $[0,1]$ such that on any open interval $I$ about $x_{0}, f$ fails to be of bounded variation on $I$.

  \item A (parametrized) curve $C$ in the plane is given by a pair of real-valued functions $f$ and $g$ defined on an interval $[a, b]$. (So as a point set, $C=\{(f(t), g(t)) \mid t \in[a, b]\}$.) The length of $C$ is defined to be

\end{enumerate}
$$
\sup \left\{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[\left(f\left(t_{i}\right)-f\left(t_{i-1}\right)\right)^{2}+\left(g\left(t_{i}\right)-g\left(t_{i-1}\right)\right)^{2}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\right\}
$$
where the sup is taken over all partitions $a=t_{0}<t_{1}<t_{2}<\cdots<t_{n-1}<t_{n}=b$. True-False? The length of $C$ is finite if and only if $f$ and $g$ are of bounded variation.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item Let $\left\{U_{n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of open sets in $[0,1]$. True-False? If the interior of $K:=\cap_{n=1}^{\infty} U_{n}$ is empty, then the Lebesgue measure of $K$ is zero.

  \item Let $f$ be a non-negative real-valued function defined on the interval $[0,1]$. True-False? $f$ is measurable if and only if there is a (finite or infinite) sequence $\left\{E_{n}\right\}$ of measurable subsets of $[0,1]$ and a sequence of non-negative constants $\left\{c_{n}\right\}$ such that $f(x)=\sum c_{n} 1_{E_{n}}(x)$ for every $x \in[0,1]$.

  \item Let $\left\{f_{n}\right\}_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of non-negative Lebesgue measurable functions defined on $\mathbb{R}$ that converges almost everywhere (with respect to Lebesgue measure $m$ ) to the function $f$. True-False? If $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_{n} d m=0$, then $f=0$ a.e. with respect to $m$.

\end{enumerate}
\section{Part II}
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{6}
  \item Let $P_{n}(z):=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(k+1) z^{k}, n=1,2, \cdots$ and let $0<r<1$. True-False? There is an $n_{0}$ such that for all $n>n_{0}, P_{n}$ has no zero in the $\operatorname{disc}\{|z|<r\}$.

  \item Suppose $a$ is an isolated singularity of $f$ and suppose the real part of $f, \mathfrak{R}(f(z))$, satisfies the inequality $\mathfrak{R}(f(z)) \leq-m \ln |z-a|$ for some positive integer $m$ and for $z$ in some disc centered at $a$. What kind of singularity is $a$ ? (Is it removable, a pole, or essential?)

  \item Let $C$ be the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=2 x$ oriented in the counter clockwise direction. Calculate $\int_{C} \frac{d z}{z^{4}+1}$.

  \item Let $\Omega$ be a region in the plain, $\mathbb{C}$, and let $\mathcal{F}_{\Omega}=\cup_{n \geq 0}\left\{f|f| \Omega=z^{n}\right\}$. Identify all the regions $\Omega$ such that $\mathcal{F}_{\Omega}$ is a normal family. 10. Suppose the series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_{n} z^{n}$ converges in the open unit disc and that $b_{n} \geq 0$ for all $n$. Let

\end{enumerate}
$$
\mathcal{F}=\left\{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}|| a_{n} \mid \leq b_{n}\right\}
$$
True-False? $\mathcal{F}$ is a normal family.

Instructions. Be sure to put your name on each booklet you use.

Much of this examination is "true-false". When a problem begins with "True-false", you are to decide if the operative assertion is true or false. If you decide that it is "true", you are to give a proof, while if you decide that it is "false", you are to present a counter example or explain why it is false.

The exam is divided into two parts. The first tests your knowledge of real analysis and the second tests your knowledge of complex analysis. Each part has 5 problems. You need only work 4 problems in each part. Please indicate which 4 you are submitting for evaluation. If you want to do five in a part, that is OK.

This examination is a true-false test. Each problem contains a statement that is either true or false. If you believe a statement is true, you must indicate so and give a proof. If you think it is false, you must indicate so and present a counter example.

The exam is divided into two parts. The first covers real analysis and the second covers complex analysis. Each part has 5 problems. You need only work 4 problems in each part. You must indicate which 4 you are submitting for evaluation. If you want to do five in a part, that is OK. We will treat the extra problem as a bonus.

\section{Part I}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $f$ be a bounded measurable function on the interval $[0,1]$ and let $\epsilon>0$ be given. Then there is a step function $\sigma$ on $[0,1]$ such that $|f(x)-\sigma(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $x \in[0,1]$.

  \item If $\left\{f_{n}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a uniformly bounded sequence of nonnegative, Lebesgue integrable functions on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\left\{f_{n}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to zero pointwise on $\mathbb{R}$, then $\int_{\mathbb{R}} f_{n}(x) d x \rightarrow 0$.

  \item Suppose $\left\{f_{n}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a uniformly bounded sequence of Lebesgue measurable functions defined on [0,1] and for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $x \in[0,1]$, let $F_{n}(x)=\int_{0}^{x} f_{n}(t) d t$. Then the sequence $\left\{F_{n}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is equicontinuous on $[0,1]$.

  \item The composition of two absolutely continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$ is absolutely continuous; i.e., if $f$ and $g$ are two absolutely continuous functions defined on $\mathbb{R}$, then $f \circ g$ is absolutely continuous.

  \item If $f$ is a continuous, non-decreasing function defined on $[0,1]$ and if $E \subseteq[0,1]$ is a set of Lebesgue measure zero, then $f(E)$ is a set of Lebesgue measure zero.

\end{enumerate}
\section{Part II}
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{6}
  \item The equation $\sin (z)=2$ has no solutions in the complex plane.

  \item Suppose $f$ is analytic in a region $G$ (in the complex plane) and that for some positive integer $n$, the $n^{t h}$ derivative of $f$ achieves its maximum modulus at a point $z_{0}$ in $G$. Then $f$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$.

  \item Let $G$ be a region in the complex plane and let $z_{0}$ be a point in $G$. Suppose that $f$ is a function defined and analytic on $G \backslash\left\{z_{0}\right\}$ and that $f$ maps $G \backslash\left\{z_{0}\right\}$ into the upper half-plane. Then $z_{0}$ is a removable singularity of $f$.

  \item The function $f(z)=\csc (z)$ has a simple pole at $z=0$ and its residue there is 1 .

  \item Let $G$ be the open upper half-plane and for $z \in G$ define

\end{enumerate}
$$
\psi_{n}(z):=\exp \left\{\frac{i-(z-n)}{i+(z-n)}\right\},
$$
for $z \in G$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $\left\{\psi_{n}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a normal family in $H(G)$ with no non-constant limit points.

Instructions. Be sure to put your name on each booklet you use.

This examination has a number of "true-false" questions in it. When a problem is a true-false problem, the operative statement will be preceded by True-False?. You are to decide whether it is true or false. If you think it is true, you must provide a proof. If you think it is false, you must provide a counter example or a proof of why it is false. No points will be given for a correct guess that the problem is true or false without any justification. Also, there will be no "Bankruptcy" points given.

The exam is divided into two parts. The first covers real analysis and the second covers complex analysis. Each part has 5 problems. You need only work 4 problems in each part. You must indicate which 4 you are submitting for evaluation. If you want to do five in a part, that is OK. We will treat the extra problem as a bonus, but still mark the four problems (in each part) that you think are your best work.

\section{Part I}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $f$ be a real-valued continuous function mapping $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$. True-False? $f$ is absolutely continuous if and only if $f$ maps Lebesgue null sets to Lebesgue null sets.

  \item Suppose $f$ is a non-negative Lebesgue integrable function defined on $[0,1]$. True-False? There is a Lebesgue measurable set $E \subseteq[0,1]$ such that $f=1_{E}$ if and only if $\int_{0}^{1} f^{n} d \mu=\int_{0}^{1} f d \mu$ for all positive integers $n$.

  \item For what values of $\alpha>0$ is the function $x \rightarrow x^{\alpha}$ absolutely continuous on every bounded subinterval of $[0, \infty)$ ?

  \item Let $\sigma$ be the function defined by the formula

\end{enumerate}
$$
\sigma(x):= \begin{cases}0, & x \leq 0 \\ 1, & x>0\end{cases}
$$
and let $\sigma^{*}$ be the outer measure determined by $\sigma$. True-False Every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is measurable with respect to $\sigma^{*}$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{5}
  \item True-False The function
\end{enumerate}
$$
f(x):=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \sin (k x) / k^{m}
$$
is of bounded variation over every finite interval whenever $m>2$.

\section{Part II}
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{6}
  \item Suppose $f$ is holomorphic in the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$. Suppose also that for each $z \in \mathbb{D}$ there is an integer $n(z)$ such that the derivative $f^{(n(z))}$ vanishes at $z$. True-False? $f$ must be a polynomial.

  \item True-False? There is a holomorphic function $f$ on the closed unit disc such that $f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{n+2}, n \geq 1$.

  \item A function $f$ defined and analytic on a region $G$ is said to have a fixed point $z$ in $G$ if $f(z)=z$. If $f$ is analytic in a region that contains the closed unit disc and if $|f(z)|<1$ for all $z,|z|=1$, how many fixed points does $f$ have in the open unit disc?

  \item True-False? The function of $r$

\end{enumerate}
$$
\varphi(r):=\int_{|z|=r} \frac{\sin z}{z^{2}+1} d z, \quad r \neq 1
$$
can be extended to a continuous function defined on all of $[0, \infty)$. 10. Recall that a function $f$ defined on the extended complex plane $\widehat{\mathbf{C}}:=\mathbb{C} \cup\{\infty\}$ is said to be meromorphic on $\widehat{\mathbf{C}}$ in case $f$ is meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ and $f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)$ has a non-essential singularity at $z=0$. Show that a nonconstant function that is meromorphic on $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ has the same number of zeros and poles in $\widehat{\mathbf{C}}$.

Instructions. Be sure to put your name on each booklet you use.

Much of this examination is "true-false". When a problem begins with "True-false", you are to decide if the operative assertion is true or false. If you decide that it is "true", you are to give a proof, while if you decide that it is "false", you are to present a counter example.

The exam is divided into two parts. The first covers real analysis and the second covers complex analysis. Each part has 5 problems. You need only work 4 problems in each part. You must indicate which 4 you are submitting for evaluation. If you want to do five in a part, that is OK. We will treat the extra problem as a bonus.

\section{Part I}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item True-false. Lebesgue measure is continuous in the sense that the Lebesgue measure of the closure of a set coincides with the Lebesgue measure of the set.

  \item True-false. Let $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ be two disjoint open intervals, and for $i=1,2$, let $A_{i}$ be an arbitrary subset of $I_{i}$. Then $m^{*}\left(A_{1} \cup A_{2}\right)=m^{*}\left(A_{1}\right)+m^{*}\left(A_{2}\right)$, where $m^{*}$ denotes Lebesgue outer measure.

  \item True-false. Let $\left\{f_{n}\right\}_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of non-negative integrable functions defined on $\mathbb{R}$ such that

\end{enumerate}
$$
0 \leq f_{1}(x) \leq f_{2}(x) \leq f_{3}(x) \leq \ldots
$$
and such that the sequence of numbers $\left\{\int_{\mathbb{R}} f_{n}(x) d x\right\}$ is bounded. Let $f(x)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} f_{n}(x)$. Then $f(x)<\infty$ for almost all $x .$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{4}
  \item True-false. Let $\sigma$ be the function on $\mathbb{R}$ that is zero to the left of $1,1 / 2$ for $1 \leq x<2,3 / 4$ for $2 \leq x<3$, $7 / 8$ for $3 \leq x<4$, etc. (Thus, $\sigma$ jumps by $2^{-n}$ at $n$ for $n=1,2, \ldots$, is constant between any two consecutive integers and is continuous from the right.) If $f(x)=x$ on $\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is integrable with respect to the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure determined by $\sigma$.

  \item Let $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ be a uniformly bounded sequence of measurable functions defined on the interval $[0,1]$ and let

\end{enumerate}
$$
F_{n}(x)=\int_{0}^{x} f_{n}(t) d t \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1
$$
Show that there is a subsequence $\left\{F_{n_{k}}\right\}$ that converges uniformly on $[0,1]$.

\section{Part II}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item True-false. Suppose $f$ is analytic in the region $0<|z|<1$ and suppose that for each $r, 0<r<1$, the integral $\int_{C_{r}} f(z) d z=0$, where $C_{r}$ is the circle $|z|=r$. Then $f$ is analytic on the open unit disc.

  \item Suppose $f$ is analytic in the annular region $1-\epsilon<|z|<2+\epsilon$ for some positive $\epsilon$. Suppose also that $|f| \leq 1$ on the circle $|z|=1$ and that $|f| \leq 4$ on the circle $|z|=2$. Show that $|f(z)| \leq|z|^{2}$ for all $z$, $1<|z|<2$

  \item True-false. Let $\mathfrak{G}$ be a domain and let $z_{0}$ be a point in $\mathfrak{G}$. Suppose $f$ is analytic in $\mathfrak{G} /\left\{z_{0}\right\}$ and that $f$ takes values in the upper half-plane. Then $z_{0}$ is a removable singularity of $f$.

  \item Find the Laurent series representation of the function

\end{enumerate}
$$
f(z)=\frac{1}{z^{2}(1-z)}
$$
that is valid in the region $1<|z|<\infty$. 5. Let $f$ be analytic in the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ and let the Taylor series expansion for $f$ be
$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}
$$
